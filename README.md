# Cricket-Live
Cricket-Live is a windows GUI app , it shows live  cricket scores in a small screen on the corner of your screen so that you don't need to keep checking scores while working.
I have used PyQt4 framework for designing GUI of the app.
The program parses html page from cricbuzz.com using python module Beautiful Soup.
